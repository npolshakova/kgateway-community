# K8sGateway Charter

## Mission 

The K8sGateway project strives to provide the best API Gateway for Kubernetes.

## Scope

K8sGateway is a control plane and data plane built for Kubernetes which implements the Kubernetes Gateway API standard for traffic routing. Deployment of the control plane on other platforms is not tested, nor supported in any way by the K8sGateway community but our gateway can handle traffic for a wide variety of destination platforms. Our core focus is on building a reliable, performant control plane with limited extensions to our shipped Envoy proxy data plane.

## Values

### Inclusive

K8sGateway was initially created by a capable group of engineers with deep experience building proven control planes and proxies but without diverse input this project can never be at its best. We strive to build an inclusive community where all good-faith input is appreciated and diverse opinions and contributions are welcomed.

### Merit

We weigh contributions based on their merits, not based on their source. We recognize that finding time for open source contributions can be challenging and appreciate the time and effort our contributors put into their work.

### Open

K8sGateway is open source. We believe through combined efforts, shared experience and the strength of open community we can build a better API Gateway.
