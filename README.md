Welcome! Kgateway is excited you are interested in our community.

Kgateway is an open source, cloud-native Layer 7 proxy that is based on [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/). The kgateway project implements gateway routing by using [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) resources.

This repository contains helpful information regarding the structure and functioning of the kgateway community, including how to get involved.
