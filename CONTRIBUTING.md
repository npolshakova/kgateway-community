# Contributing to K8sGateway

Excited about K8sGateway and want to help make it better?

Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

* [Filing issues](#filing-issues)
* [Small bug fixes](#small-bug-fixes)
* [Big pull requests](#big-prs)
* [Code review guidelines](#code-review-guidelines)

## Filing issues

If you encounter a bug, please file an issue on GitHub in the k8sgateway/k8sgateway repo.
If an issue you have is already reported, please add additional information or add a 👍 reaction to indicate your agreement.

## Small bug fixes

If your bug fix is small (around 20 lines of code) just open a pull request. We will try to merge it as soon as possible,
just make sure that you include a test that verifies the bug you are fixing.

## Big PRs

This includes:

* Big bug fixes
* New features

For significant changes to the codebase, it’s important to settle on a design before starting on the implementation. [Reaching out to us in CNCF slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C080D3PJMS4) early will help minimize the amount of possible wasted effort and will ensure that major improvements are given enough attention.

1. Community/contributor meeting
-->

1. **Open an issue**: Open an issue about your bug in the k8sgateway/k8sgateway repo.
2. **Message us on Slack**: Reach out to us to discuss your proposed changes in our [CNCF slack channel, #k8sgateway](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C080D3PJMS4).
3. **Agree on implementation plan**: Write a plan for how this feature or bug fix should be implemented. Should this be one pull request or multiple incremental improvements? Who is going to do each part? Discuss it with us on slack or join our [community meeting](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=ZDI0MzgzOWExMGYwMzAxZjVkYjQ0YTU0NmQ1MDJmODA5YTBjZDcwZGI4ZTBhZGNhMzIwYWRlZjJkOTQ4MzU5Y0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
4. **Submit a draft PR**: It's important to get feedback as early as possible to ensure that any big improvements end up being merged. Open a draft pull request and label it `work in progress` to start getting feedback.
5. **Review**: At least one maintainer should sign off on the change before it’s merged. Look at the following [Code review](#code-review-guidelines) section to learn about what we're looking for.
6. **Close out**: A maintainer will merge the PR and let you know about the next release plan.

## Code review guidelines

It’s important that every piece of code in K8sGateway is reviewed by at least one maintainer familiar with that codebase.

1. **Changelog**: The K8sGateway project uses [GitHub's automatically generated release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) feature. As such, make sure that your PR description includes a clear, concise message of the change, including any user-facing steps to use the feature.
2. **CI check**: A maintainer needs to kick off the CI process by commenting `/test` on your PR.
3. **Testing**: Please write tests for your changes. Bias towards fast / unit testing.
4. **Comments**: The code reviewer may leave comments to discuss changes. Minor preferences are often called out with `nit`.
5. **PR Description**: Is well formatted, concise and descriptive enough to be used as a release note.
