# K8sGateway community roles

This document describes the different individual roles community members can have, the requirements of each role, and the privileges that come with the role.

## Summary

The organization has two named roles: Reviewer and Maintainer. An individual may also have one or more Specialization Areas which denote their area(s) of expertise.

## Reviewer

Reviewer is the first step towards becoming a maintainer. Reviewers should be active in the community and have been actively contributing for 3 months. A reviewer will be granted the ability to manage GitHub Issues and Pull Requests in one or more project repositories based on their expertise and project contributions.

## Maintainer

Becoming a maintainer is a significant step, however, it is not required to be a valued and contributing member of the community. Before applying to be a maintainer, you should meet the following criteria:

- Be a reviewer for at least 6 months.
- Remained active in the project. This can include contributing code or documentation, reviewing PRs, voting during conflict resolution, attending community meetings, etc.
- Made 20 substantial contributions to the project in the area you seek to be a maintainer for.
- Be knowledgable about the area of the project you seek to be a maintainer for.

**Note**: Other maintainers in the area will review your application so it is beneficial if you built a relationship and established trust with one or more maintainers to ensure the best chances for success.

### Maintainers emerita

If a maintainer has been inactive for more than 1 year, a member of the community may file a PR thanking the maintainer for their contributions and moving them to [Emeritus](https://glossary.cncf.io/contributor-ladder/#stepping-downemeritus-process) status. The maintainer being honored may approve the PR to accept or leave a comment with an explanation for their absence. The maintainer being honored should be given generous time to respond before merging the organization change. If inactivity becomes a concern for the project, but maintainers do not wish to leave the project entirely, they should step back to reviewer.
